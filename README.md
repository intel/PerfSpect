## What is PerfSpect
This command-line tool is designed to help you analyze and optimize Linux servers and the software running on them. Whether you’re a system administrator, a developer, or a performance engineer, this tool provides comprehensive insights and actionable recommendations to enhance performance and efficiency.

## Getting PerfSpect
```
$ wget -qO- https://github.com/intel/PerfSpect/releases/latest/download/perfspect.tgz | tar xvz
$ cd perfspect
```
## Running PerfSpect
PerfSpect includes a suite of commands designed to analyze and optimize both system and software performance.

Run `perfspect -h` for top level help. Note the available commands and options.

### Quick Start for Users of Intel PerfSpect 1.x
PerfSpect has undergone a re-design for the 3.x release. Prior releases of PerfSpect required two stages: 

1) collect raw event data
2) process the raw event data into user-friendly metrics

The 3.x design combines these two steps into one...producing user-friendly metrics. Run `perfspect metrics` for the new experience.

Also available with 3.x are "live metrics" where metrics are printed to stdout as they are collected. Try `perfspect metrics --live`.

### Quick Start for Users of Intel System Health Inspector (AKA "svr-info") 2.x
Svr-info functionality is now included in PerfSpect. The svr-info configuration report is generated by running `perfspect report`. Benchmarks can be executed by running `perfspect report --benchmark all`. Run `perfspect flame` to generate a software flamegraph. And, run `perfspect telemetry` to collect system telemetry.

### Commands
| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [`perfspect config`](#config-command) | Modify system configuration |
| [`perfspect flame`](#flame-command) | Generate flamegraphs |
| [`perfspect metrics`](#metrics-command) | Monitor core and uncore metrics |
| [`perfspect report`](#report-command) | Generate configuration report |
| [`perfspect telemetry`](#telemetry-command) | Collect system telemetry |

Each command has additional help text that can be viewed by running `perfspect <command> -h`.

#### Config Command
The `config` command provides a method to view and change various system configuration parameters. Run `perfspect config -h` to view the parameters that can be modified. <b>USE CAUTION</b> when changing system parameters. It is possible to configure the system in a way that it will no longer operate. In some cases, a reboot will be required to return to the default settings. 

Example:
```
$ ./perfspect config --cores 24 --llc 2.0 --uncoremaxfreq 1.8
...
```
#### Flame Command
Software flamegraphs are useful in diagnosing software performance bottlenecks. Run `perfspect flame -h` to capture a system-wide software flamegraph.
#### Metrics Command
The `metrics` command provides system performance characterization metrics. The metrics provided are dependent on the platform architecture.

Example:
```
$ ./perfspect metrics --duration 30
emr                   ⣯  collection complete                     

Metric files:
  /home/jharper5/dev/pt/perfspect_2024-10-10_10-58-36/emr_metrics.csv
  /home/jharper5/dev/pt/perfspect_2024-10-10_10-58-36/emr_metrics_summary.csv
  /home/jharper5/dev/pt/perfspect_2024-10-10_10-58-36/emr_metrics_summary.html
```
The `metrics` command supports two modes -- default and "live". Default mode behaves as above -- metrics are collected and saved into files for review.  The "live" mode prints the metrics in a selected format, e.g., CSV, JSON, to stdout where they can be viewed in the console and/or redirected into a file or observability pipeline.

##### No Root Permissions
If sudo is not possible and running as the root user is not possible, use the `--noroot` flag on the command line, e.g., `perfspect metrics --noroot`, and request an administrator make the following changes to the target system:
- sysctl -w kernel.perf_event_paranoid=0
- sysctl -w kernel.nmi_watchdog=0
- write '125' to all perf_event_mux_interval_ms files found under /sys/devices/*, e.g., `for i in $(find /sys/devices -name perf_event_mux_interval_ms); do echo 125 > $i; done`

See `perfspect metrics -h` for the extensive set of options and examples.

#### Report Command
The `report` command generates system configuration reports in a variety of formats. By default, all categories of information are collected:
```
$ ./perfspect report 
soc-PF4W5A3V          ⢿  collection complete                     

Report files:
  /home/myuser/dev/perfspect/perfspect_2024-09-03_17-45-40/soc-PF4W5A3V.html
  /home/myuser/dev/perfspect/perfspect_2024-09-03_17-45-40/soc-PF4W5A3V.xlsx
  /home/myuser/dev/perfspect/perfspect_2024-09-03_17-45-40/soc-PF4W5A3V.json
  /home/myuser/dev/perfspect/perfspect_2024-09-03_17-45-40/soc-PF4W5A3V.txt
```
It's possible to collect a subset of information by providing command line options. Note that by specifying only the `txt` format, it is printed to stdout, as well as written to a report file.
```
$ ./perfspect report --bios --os --format txt

See `perfspect report -h` for all options.

###### Memory Benchmark Requirements
Memory benchmarks executed through the PerfSpect report command require the Intel® Memory Latency Checker application. It can be downloaded from here: [MLC](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/736633/intel-memory-latency-checker-intel-mlc.html). Once downloaded, extract the Linux executable and place it in the perfspect/tools/x86_64 directory.

#### Telemetry Command
The `telemetry` command runs telemetry collectors on the specified target(s) and then generates reports of the results. By default, all telemetry types are collected. To select telemetry types, additional command line options are available (see `perfspect telemetry -h`).
```
$ ./perfspect telemetry --duration 30
soc-PF4W5A3V          ⣾  collection complete

```

### Common Command Options

#### Local vs. Remote Targets
By default, PerfSpect targets the local host, i.e., the host where PerfSpect is running. Remote system(s) can also be targetted when the remote systems are reachable through SSH from the local host.

**Important:** Ensure the remote user has password-less sudo access (or root privileges) to fully utilize PerfSpect's capabilities.

To target a single remote system using a pre-configured private key:
```
$ ./perfspect report --target 192.168.1.42 --user fred --key ~/.ssh/fredkey
...
```
To target a single remote system using a password:
```
$ ./perfspect report --target 192.168.1.42 --user fred
fred@192.168.1.42's password: ******
...
```
To target more than one remote system, a YAML file is used to provide the necessary connection parameters, e.g.:
```
$ cat targets.yaml
# This YAML file contains a list of remote targets with their corresponding properties.
# Each target has the following properties:
#   name: The name of the target (optional)
#   host: The IP address or host name of the target (required)
#   port: The port number used to connect to the target via SSH (optional)
#   user: The user name used to connect to the target via SSH (optional)
#   key: The path to the private key file used to connect to the target via SSH (optional)
#   pwd: The password used to connect to the target via SSH (optional)
#
# Note: If key and pwd are both provided, the key will be used for authentication.
#
# Security Notes: 
#   It is recommended to use a private key for authentication instead of a password.
#   Keep this file in a secure location and do not expose it to unauthorized users.
#
# Below are examples. Modify them to match your environment.
targets:
  - name: ELAINES_TARGET
    host: 192.168.1.1
    port: 
    user: elaine
    key: /home/elaine/.ssh/id_rsa
    pwd:
  - name: JERRYS_TARGET
    host: 192.168.1.2
    port: 2222
    user: jerry
    key:
    pwd: george

$ ./perfspect report --benchmark speed,memory --targets targets.yaml
...
```
