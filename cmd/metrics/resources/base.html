Frontend denotes the first part of the processor core responsible to fetch operations that are executed later on by the Backend part. Within the Frontend; a branch predictor predicts the next address to fetch; cache-lines are fetched from the memory subsystem; parsed into instructions; and lastly decoded into micro-operations (uops). Ideally the Frontend can issue Pipeline_Width uops every cycle to the Backend. Frontend Bound denotes unutilized issue-slots when there is no Backend stall; i.e. bubbles where Frontend delivered no uops while Backend could have accepted them. For example; stalls due to instruction-cache misses would be categorized under Frontend Bound.",

        "TMA_....Branch_Resteers(%)": "This metric represents fraction of cycles the CPU was stalled due to Branch Resteers. Branch Resteers estimates the Frontend delay in fetching operations from corrected path; following all sorts of miss-predicted branches. For example; branchy code with lots of miss-predictions might get categorized under Branch Resteers. Note the value of this node may overlap with its siblings.",

This pipeline is used for code that was not pre-cached in the DSB or LSD. For example; inefficiencies due to asymmetric decoders; use of long immediate or LCP can manifest as MITE fetch bandwidth bottleneck.",

        "TMA_Bad_Speculation(%)": "This category represents fraction of slots wasted due to incorrect speculations. This include slots used to issue uops that do not eventually get retired and slots for which the issue-pipeline was blocked due to recovery from earlier incorrect speculation. For example; wasted work due to miss-predicted branches are categorized under Bad Speculation category. Incorrect data speculation followed by Memory Ordering Nukes is another example.",
        "TMA_..Branch_Mispredicts(%)": "This metric represents fraction of slots the CPU has wasted due to Branch Misprediction.  These slots are either wasted by uops fetched from an incorrectly speculated program path; or stalls when the out-of-order part of the machine needs to recover its state from a speculative path.",
        "TMA_..Machine_Clears(%)": "This metric represents fraction of slots the CPU has wasted due to Machine Clears.  These slots are either wasted by uops fetched prior to the clear; or stalls the out-of-order portion of the machine needs to recover its state after the clear. For example; this can happen due to memory ordering Nukes (e.g. Memory Disambiguation) or Self-Modifying-Code (SMC) nukes.",
        "TMA_Backend_Bound(%)": "This category represents fraction of slots where no uops are being delivered due to a lack of required resources for accepting new uops in the Backend. Backend is the portion of the processor core where the out-of-order scheduler dispatches ready uops into their respective execution units; and once completed these uops get retired according to program order. For example; stalls due to data-cache misses or stalls due to the divider unit being overloaded are both categorized under Backend Bound. Backend Bound is further divided into two main categories: Memory Bound and Core Bound.",
        "TMA_..Memory_Bound(%)": "This metric represents fraction of slots the Memory subsystem within the Backend was a bottleneck.  Memory Bound estimates fraction of slots where pipeline is likely stalled due to demand load or store instructions. This accounts mainly for (1) non-completed in-flight memory demand loads which coincides with execution units starvation; in addition to (2) cases where stores could impose backpressure on the pipeline when many of them get buffered at the same time (less common out of the two).",
        "TMA_....L1_Bound(%)": "This metric estimates how often the CPU was stalled without loads missing the L1 data cache.  The L1 data cache typically has the shortest latency.  However; in certain cases like loads blocked on older stores; a load might suffer due to high latency even though it is being satisfied by the L1. Another example is loads who miss in the TLB. These cases are characterized by execution unit stalls; while some non-completed demand load lives in the machine without having that demand load missing the L1 cache.",
        "TMA_......DTLB_Load(%)": "This metric roughly estimates the fraction of cycles where the Data TLB (DTLB) was missed by load accesses. TLBs (Translation Look-aside Buffers) are processor caches for recently used entries out of the Page Tables that are used to map virtual- to physical-addresses by the operating system. This metric approximates the potential delay of demand loads missing the first-level data TLB (assuming worst case scenario with back to back misses to different pages). This includes hitting in the second-level TLB (STLB) as well as performing a hardware page walk on an STLB miss.",
        "TMA_....L2_Bound(%)": "This metric estimates how often the CPU was stalled due to L2 cache accesses by loads.  Avoiding cache misses (i.e. L1 misses/L2 hits) can improve the latency and increase performance.",
        "TMA_....L3_Bound(%)": "This metric estimates how often the CPU was stalled due to loads accesses to L3 cache or contended with a sibling Core.  Avoiding cache misses (i.e. L2 misses/L3 hits) can improve the latency and increase performance.",
        "TMA_......Data_Sharing(%)": "This metric estimates fraction of cycles while the memory subsystem was handling synchronizations due to data-sharing accesses. Data shared by multiple Logical Processors (even just read shared) may cause increased access latency due to cache coherency. Excessive data sharing can drastically harm multithreaded performance.",
        "TMA_......MEM_Bandwidth(%)": "This metric estimates fraction of cycles where the core's performance was likely hurt due to approaching bandwidth limits of external memory (DRAM).  The underlying heuristic assumes that a similar off-core traffic is generated by all IA cores. This metric does not aggregate non-data-read requests by this logical processor; requests from other IA Logical Processors/Physical Cores/sockets; or other non-IA devices like GPU; hence the maximum external memory bandwidth limits may or may not be approached when this metric is flagged (see Uncore counters for that).",
        "TMA_......MEM_Latency(%)": "This metric estimates fraction of cycles where the performance was likely hurt due to latency from external memory (DRAM).  This metric does not aggregate requests from other Logical Processors/Physical Cores/sockets (see Uncore counters for that).",
        "TMA_....Store_Bound(%)": "This metric estimates how often CPU was stalled  due to RFO store memory accesses; RFO store issue a read-for-ownership request before the write. Even though store accesses do not typically stall out-of-order CPUs; there are few cases where stores can lead to actual stalls. This metric will be flagged should RFO stores be a bottleneck.",
        "TMA_..Core_Bound(%)": "This metric represents fraction of slots where Core non-memory issues were of a bottleneck.  Shortage in hardware compute resources; or dependencies in software's instructions are both categorized under Core Bound. Hence it may indicate the machine ran out of an out-of-order resource; certain execution units are overloaded or dependencies in program's data- or instruction-flow are limiting the performance (e.g. FP-chained long-latency arithmetic operations).",
        "TMA_....Ports_Utilization(%)": "This metric estimates fraction of cycles the CPU performance was potentially limited due to Core computation issues (non divider-related).  Two distinct categories can be attributed into this metric: (1) heavy data-dependency among contiguous instructions would manifest in this metric - such cases are often referred to as low Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP). (2) Contention on some hardware execution unit other than Divider. For example; when there are too many multiply operations.",
        "TMA_Retiring(%)": "This category represents fraction of slots utilized by useful work i.e. issued uops that eventually get retired. Ideally; all pipeline slots would be attributed to the Retiring category.  Retiring of 100% would indicate the maximum Pipeline_Width throughput was achieved.  Maximizing Retiring typically increases the Instructions-per-cycle (see IPC metric). Note that a high Retiring value does not necessary mean there is no room for more performance.  For example; Heavy-operations or Microcode Assists are categorized under Retiring. They often indicate suboptimal performance and can often be optimized or avoided. ",
        "TMA_..Light_Operations(%)": "This metric represents fraction of slots where the CPU was retiring light-weight operations -- instructions that require no more than one uop (micro-operation). This correlates with total number of instructions used by the program. A uops-per-instruction (see UopPI metric) ratio of 1 or less should be expected for decently optimized software running on Intel Core/Xeon products. While this often indicates efficient X86 instructions were executed; high value does not necessarily mean better performance cannot be achieved.",
        "TMA_....FP_Arith(%)": "This metric represents overall arithmetic floating-point (FP) operations fraction the CPU has executed (retired). Note this metric's value may exceed its parent due to use of \"Uops\" CountDomain and FMA double-counting.",
        "TMA_..Heavy_Operations(%)": "This metric represents fraction of slots where the CPU was retiring heavy-weight operations -- instructions that require two or more uops or micro-coded sequences. This highly-correlates with the uop length of these instructions/sequences.",
        "IO_bandwidth_disk_or_network_writes (MB/sec)": "Bandwidth of IO reads that are initiated by end device controllers that are requesting memory from the CPU.",
        "IO_bandwidth_disk_or_network_reads (MB/sec)": "Bandwidth of IO writes that are initiated by end device controllers that are writing memory to the CPU.",
        "TMA_..Fetch_Latency(%)": "This metric represents fraction of slots the CPU was stalled due to Frontend latency issues.  For example; instruction-cache misses; iTLB misses or fetch stalls after a branch misprediction are categorized under Frontend Latency. In such cases; the Frontend eventually delivers no uops for some period.",
        "TMA_......Unknown_Branches(%)": "This metric represents fraction of cycles the CPU was stalled due to new branch address clears. These are fetched branches the Branch Prediction Unit was unable to recognize (e.g. first time the branch is fetched or hitting BTB capacity limit).",
        "TMA_..Fetch_Bandwidth(%)": "This metric represents fraction of slots the CPU was stalled due to Frontend bandwidth issues.  For example; inefficiencies at the instruction decoders; or restrictions for caching in the DSB (decoded uops cache) are categorized under Fetch Bandwidth. In such cases; the Frontend typically delivers suboptimal amount of uops to the Backend.",
        "TMA_......FP_Scalar(%)": "This metric approximates arithmetic floating-point (FP) scalar uops fraction the CPU has retired. May overcount due to FMA double counting.",
        "TMA_......FP_Vector(%)": "This metric approximates arithmetic floating-point (FP) vector uops fraction the CPU has retired aggregated across all vector widths. May overcount due to FMA double counting.",
        "UPI Data transmit BW (MB/sec) (only data)": "Intel(R) Ultra Path Interconnect (UPI) data transmit bandwidth (MB/sec)",
        "TMA_......Lock_Latency(%)": "This metric represents fraction of cycles the CPU spent handling cache misses due to lock operations. Due to the microarchitecture handling of locks; they are classified as L1_Bound regardless of what memory source satisfied them.",
        "TMA_......False_Sharing(%)": "This metric roughly estimates how often CPU was handling synchronizations due to False Sharing. False Sharing is a multithreading hiccup; where multiple Logical Processors contend on different data-elements mapped into the same cache line. ",
